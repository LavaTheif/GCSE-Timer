This webpage is designed to time a GCSE exam.  It keeps track of the current time, the time the exam started<br>
and the time that they will need to finish.  It also adds on 25% extra time for the students that require<br>
more time to complete the exam than the others.  All that is entered by the exams officer is the length of<br>
the exam and the name of it.  This can be done for up to 4 exams at once which saves time if you are trying<br>
to make sure all the times are correct and the pupils arnt losing or gaining any random time from a slight<br>
mis-calculation.<br><br>

It supports formatting for the name of the exam, for example typing '&ltb&gtMaths&lt/b&gt' will result in the<br>
title becoming bold, '<b>Maths</b>'. Other formats include, <i>italics</i>, &lti&gt, <u>underline</u>, &ltu&gt, and <mark>marked</mark>, &ltmark&gt,<br>
and a couple more which can be found <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp">here</a>.<br><br>
